Hardware is a Single Page Application which allows the management of the equipment of a computer park.
With this web app, you can perform operations on
- Equipment
- Users
- Services
- And breakdowns.

The technologies I used to develop it:
- Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node JS && Express, MySQL.
